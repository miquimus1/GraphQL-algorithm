# Normalize GraphQL

In 2012, Facebook was rebuilding their Facebook's native mobile applications. As Facebook's mobile apps became more complex, their mobile app suffered poor performance and it frequently crashed. After evaluating different options to implement an API data (incluiding RESTful server resources) they decided to create what we know nowadays as GraphQL. After three years of internal usage, in 2016, Facebook released the specification of this framework. This framework has become popular to the point that big companies as Netlfix, Twitter, Airbnb, Amazon or Github quickly included this framework in their projects. In spite of all the advances that this technology has brought, it has some problems derived from the lack of a formal form to create the queries. As one query can be written in so many different forms, responses times are affected producing different times even though the queries are asking for the same. This thesis attempts to solve this problem by creating an algorithm capable to rewritte the queries in order to normalize them. Normalizing the queries we will solve this problem and what is called "field collection" will not be needed.

This repository constains the tester used to test the algorithm. In the future I will push the algorithm.
